# Important Notes for C++ program

## Note # 1: #include
> - #include means that we need to include this header file in our program to use it in our program.
> - In C++, the ***#include directive*** tells the compiler to include the contents of the specified header file.
### ***For Example:***
            #include <iostream>
 
## Note # 2: " iostream " 

> - **"iostream"** is a ***header file*** that we need to include the standard input/output stream library in our program.
>- "iostream" is used for the input and output operations in C++.
- ***iostream*** is a ***header file because*** it contains function declarations and macro definitions that are used by the compiler to understand the interface of the input/output library.
- ***iostream*** is also ***a library because*** it provides a collection of pre-compiled object code that implements the input/output functions declared in the header file.
>    - ***iostream is a header file*** that declares the interface of the input/output library.
>    - ***iostream is also a library*** that provides the implementation of the input/output functions declared in the header file.

## Note # 3: int main()

> - ***int main()*** is the ***entry point*** of the program.
> - ***main()*** is a ***function*** that is used to start the program.
> - ***int *** is the ***data type*** of the ***return value*** of the ***main()*** function.
### ***For Example:***
                #include <iostream>

                int main()
                {
                    cout << "Hello, World!" <<endl;
                    return 0;
                }

## Note # 4: curly braces {}

> - ***curly braces*** are used to enclose the code blocks in the program.
> - The body of the program is enclosed in curly braces.

## Note # 5: return0;

> - ***return0;*** is used to end the program.
> - ***return0;*** means that if the program is executed successfully, it will return a value of 0.
